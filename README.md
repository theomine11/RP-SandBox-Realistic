# RP-SandBox-Realistic
(sorry for the mistakes, I'm French) The goal of this project is to create a video game style SandBox (construction ...),
RolePlay (trades, realistic,
full of functions, the most realistic possible in the functions)
Simple game engine that does not require too much resources (the game will not necessarily be very pretty). Graphic style: Simple or low poly.
The game was created with GODOT ENGINE.
